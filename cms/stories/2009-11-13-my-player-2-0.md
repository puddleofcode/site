Do you remember [My Music Player](/story/my-music-player) ?
I still hate myspace sites! Unfortunately AppJet hosting go down, but... [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) comes in. My Player 2.0 is new webapp, is completly writen in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework.

Once again ...

Want use it ?

Go for it [here](http://myplayer.heroku.com) or take a look at source code at [github](http://github.com/fazibear/myplayer).
