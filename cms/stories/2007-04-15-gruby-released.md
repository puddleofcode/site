My first version of Gadu-Gadu protocol implementation in Ruby released.

[Here](http://gruby.rubyforge.org/) is very very small portion of documentation ;)
You can download it form [rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/projects/Gruby).
Or install it via rubygems:

`# gem install GRuby`

For now it support:

- login
- send / receive message
- status change
- status description

Have fun.
