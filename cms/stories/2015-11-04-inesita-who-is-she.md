Who am I ? I am a simple, light, Ruby front-end framework. Yes, Ruby, it's all about Ruby, and its ecosystem.
Do you know me ? You really should check her [site](http://inesita-rb.github.io/).

In next few posts I try to answer few questons that are asked in the meantime, explain Inesita features, and keep you up to date with new features and development state.

We are in touch!
