My syntax highligter widget for blogger is avaiable. It's based on [SyntaxHighlighter](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/) 1.5.1.
Package include all compressed code and brushes, works in blogger mode.
This script also handle older/newer posts links.
To add it check out [this](http://fazibear.googlepages.com/blogger.html) page.
For usage information visit [this](http://code.google.com/p/syntaxhighlighter/wiki/Usage) wiki page.

Update:
All _WidgetManager magic was removed. It's simply don't work for now. Next and previous post don't use XHR. If you have any javascript errors with _WidgetManager remove this widget and add once again.
